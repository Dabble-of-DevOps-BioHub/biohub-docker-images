# README

This project was very heavily inspired by the [Pangeo Docker Images Repo] (https://github.com/pangeo-data/pangeo-docker-images) and is meant to be a very similar project, except for Bioinformatics related projects.

This project is still very much in the WIP stage!

Additionally, each image will have RStudio Server installed.

This project is in collaboration with [STEMAway.](https://stemaway.com/)
